It does this by creating a batch of individual SDFs based on making permutations from each setting specified. Alongside those it also has a standalone file called a Bulk Scenario Configuration (BSC) file that indicates how the batch was created. Before getting started, make sure to have properly set up your AWS Account . Customize Permutation Settings The Permutation Settings menu can be found in AWS Ambit Scenario Mode , which allows for the settings of the permutations generated to be specified. First select the Time of Day Types and Weather Types options as appropriate for creating permutations based on these settings. Refer to the Scenario Settings for how these will look as defaults when the generation happens. Set the range of Bulk Pedestrian Traffic and Bulk Vehicle Traffic . These are both a percent value of 0 to 1, where 1 is representative of 100%. Note: The current increment is 0.1. The Number of Permutations represents how many scenarios will be generated. This value cannot be directly changed, and is for informative purposes only. Generate Permutations To generate the bulk permutations, set the Configuration name and Batch Name first in the Permutation Settings menu. The Configuration name is the file name of BSC file. This also serves as the suffix for the folder where the batch SDFs are located. The Batch name is the prefix of the SDFs. Ambit will automatically increment these based on the number of permutations. Clicking Generate Permutation at the bottom of the Permutation Settings menu will export your batch to Amazon S3. Locating Export in Amazon S3 You can locate these files in Amazon S3 by going to your account and searching for the S3 bucket created. Inside that bucket, there will be a file and a folder corresponding to the Configuration and Batch name specified above. The file with the name of the Configuration will be the BSC that is used to control the Permutation Settings on import, as well as retain information for the Ambit Spawners to allow for re-importing. The folder will contain all of the permutations that were made as SDFs. Import Permutation Settings If you would like to import your BSC from S3 bucket, you can input the configuration name, choose the AWS Region of S3 bucket where you store that file and input the bucket name, then click the \"...\" next to the Configuration Name field. Once imported, all of the settings from the bulk configuration alongside the spawners will be placed back into the scene. Note: Spawn With Houdini will not re-import the original HDA selected. Utilizing Bulk Scenario Generation File The output file will be a *.bsc.json file, which follows JSON formatting.

This tool is called Spawn with Houdini actor and operates very similarly to the Spawn on Surface Ambit Spawner. Enable Houdini Engine for Unreal Engine 4 Plugin Make sure the Houdini Engine for Unreal plugin is installed and enabled in your Unreal Engine installation by going to Edit -> Plugins and ensuring the enabled checkbox for Houdini Engine for Unreal Engine 4 is checked. Note: Only Houdini 18.5.696 or above is supported. The Houdini plugin you download should match the installed version of Houdini you have, as well as the Unreal Engine version. Using Spawn with Houdini The Spawn with Houdini works very similarly to the Spawn on Surface . The main difference being that you can trigger the generate by the Generate Obstacles button while in the editor, and can specify Houdini Digital Assets to be selected as what to spawn. Houdini Digital Assets (HDAs) have the ability to surface user parameters for a user to update to customize what look the obstacle has. While in the editor mode, the Spawn with Houdini instance allows users to 1 generate many instances of an HDA which then randomizes the \"seed\" parameters of the HDA. By generating the obstacles here, you can pre-cook the HDAs to the screen to save on loading later. Obstacles generated at this phase will not regenerate when pressing play, nor be deleted once the play has finished. If you are not happy with the results or want to clean your world of these spawned obstacles - simply click the 2 clear obstacles button. While in the play mode, the Spawn with Houdini will automatically generate with the settings specified. These assets will also automatically be removed once the play has finished. Note: The Spawn with Houdini will only generate obstacles in play mode if there has not already been spawned actors from the editor mode. You can always change the randomization of locations and parameters by updating the 3 random seed . To dictate where the obstacles are spawned a 4 similar form can be filled out as the Spawn on Surface to match by name and/or by tag. The user can select which HDA they want to spawn in bulk by selecting it as the 5 Houdini Asset from the dropdown. Note: This asset must already be imported into Unreal Engine via the Houdini Plugin. Further Usage Multiple Spawn with Houdini actors can be placed on the scene, allowing users to create any number of settings to place HDA to the screen. If you wish to spawn more assets using the same configuration, press the 6 + symbol on top this will add a new entry. Expand the selection that appears to put in a different HDA to spawn. One of the HDA from this list will spawn on the locations that are available to spawn. You can customize which parameters are randomized from an HDA by adding their value into the 7 Parameters to Randomize section. These are the underlying parameter names in the HDA, and can be added so that specific part is randomized when the object is created.
